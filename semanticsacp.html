         <h4>    üéï A computer language is a formal language used to communicate with a computer. Types of computer languages include:</h4>
        <li>
            <ul><u>Construction language</u> ‚Äì all forms of communication by which a human can <mark>specify</mark> an executable problem solution to a computer.</ul>
            <ul><u>Command language</u> ‚Äì a language used to <mark>control</mark> the tasks of the computer itself, such as starting programs.</ul>
            <ul><u>Configuration language</u> ‚Äì a language used to <mark>write configuration</mark> files.</ul>
            <ul><u>Programming language</u> ‚Äì a formal language designed to <mark>communicate instructions</mark> to a machine, particularly a computer.</ul>
            <ul><u>Scripting language</u> ‚Äì a type of programming language which typically is <mark>interpreted at runtime</mark> rather than being compiled.</ul>
            <ul><u>Markup language</u> ‚Äì a grammar for annotating a document in a way that is <mark>syntactically distinguishable</mark> from the text, such as HTML.</ul>
            <ul><u>Modeling language</u> ‚Äì an artificial language used to <mark>express</mark> information or knowledge, often for use in computer system design.</ul>
            <ul><u>Style sheet language</u> ‚Äì a computer language that <mark>expresses the presentation</mark> of structured documents, such as CSS.</ul>
        </li>
         <h4>     ‚ùÉ Here we will talk about the examples of computer languages. Such as:</h4>
             <li>
                <ol> ‚óì Structured Language Query (SQL)</ol>
                <ol>‚óí Python</ol>
                <ol> ‚óì Java</ol>
                <ol>‚óí C</ol>
                <ol> ‚óì C++</ol>
                <ol>‚óíR</ol>
                <ol> ‚óì Go</ol>
                <ol>‚óíPearl</ol>
             </li>
         <h3>1. Structured Language Query - SLQ</h3>
             <p>Structured Language Query (SLQ) is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS). <br> SLQ is used to perform various operations on data.</p>
         <h3>2. Python</h3>
             <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for various purposes such as web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. <br> Created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and large community of developers who contribute to its ecosystem.
            </p>
         <h3>3. Java</h3>
             <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for <br> developing a range of applications, including Android apps, web applications, and enterprise software.
            </p>
         <h3>4. C</h3>
             <p>C is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s. <br> It is a fundamental language that has had a significant influence on the development of many other programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, and many others.</p>
         <h3>5. C++</h3>
             <p>C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. <br> It is a compiled language that is widely used for building operating systems, games, web browsers, and other high-performance applications.</p>
         <h3>6. R</h3>
             <p>R is a popular programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. <br> It is widely used by data analysts, data scientists, and researchers for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.</p>
         <h3>7. Go</h3>
             <p>
                Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled, designed to be concurrent and garbage-collected programming language developed by Google in 2009. <br> Go is designed to be efficient, simple, and easy to use, with a focus on concurrency and parallelism.
             </p>
         <h3>8. Pearl</h3>
             <p>
                Pearl is a programming language that was developed in the 1970s and 1980s for real-time systems, particularly in the areas of process control, industrial automation, and transportation systems. <br> Pearl is a procedural language that is designed to be efficient, reliable, and easy to use.
