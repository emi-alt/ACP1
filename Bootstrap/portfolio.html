  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Myself</h4>
  <p>Hello everyone! My name is <mark><em>Zareen</em></mark>. I study in 10th grade and I am almost 15 years old. My birthday comes on 24th July,2010. I live with my family which includes, me, my mother, my father, and my sister. I like playing badminton and football. In board games, I like chess and ludo. I also like to code for websites and games. I wish to be able to also develop AI models. This is just the intermadiate level of coding, and I hope to become a expert at it.</p>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Education</h4>
  <p>I am in 10th grade. I study at Mount Litera Zee School, Chandrapur, Maharashtra. My favourite subjects are maths, science and english. I usually get +80% and I always do well in maths. I also like AI classes in my school. It's very fun and interesting for me to learn! I love learning cool, new and awesome things. I have multiple times participated in competitions like Olympiads and some sports events.</p>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Flora and Fauna</h4>
  <p>Flora refers to plant life in a specific area. It includes various types of plants, such as trees, shrubs, grasses, ferns, and mosses. Fauna refers to the animal life in a specific area. It includes various types of animals. Flora and Fauna can be classified into different categories based on different factors. 
Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve is located in the Satpura Range of Madhya Pradesh, India. It is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, making it an important ecological hotspot.  The flora of the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve majorly includes teak, wild mango, sal, bamboo, terminalia, and various species of orchids, ferns, and medicinal plants. Fauna of the Pachmarhi forest includes the Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Indian bison or gaur, sambar deer, Indian giant squirrel, and various species of birds, snakes, and amphibians, including the Indian pitta, paradise flycatcher, and Indian python. The Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve is an important area for biodiversity conservation and provides a unique habitat for many species of plants and animals.

  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">Endemic Species</h4>
  <p>Endemic species are plants or animals that are found only in a specific geographic area and nowhere else in the world. Species is a group of individuals indicated by similar features and a common name that can interbreed to produce fertile offspring under natural conditions. Endemic species have adapted to their unique environment and have evolved in isolation from other populations. They can be found in various ecosystems, such as islands, mountains, or isolated habitats. For example, imagine an island that has been separated from the mainland for millions of years. The plants and animals on this island have evolved separately from their relatives on the mainland, resulting in unique species that are only found on that island. These species are considered endemic to the island. 

For example, Sal and wild mango trees are endemic flora species found in the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve. The bison, flying squirrel, and Indian giant squirrel are examples of endemic fauna species that inhabit this region.</p>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">Endangered Animals</h4>
  <p>Endangered animals are species that are at risk of becoming extinct due to various factors such as climate change, habitat loss, and poaching. In India, there are several endangered animals that need protection and conservation efforts to ensure their survival.
    The Bengal tiger is the national animal of India and is known for its beautiful striped coat and powerful presence. Their population has been declining due to habitat loss, poaching for their fur and body parts, and human-tiger conflicts. Conservation efforts like Project Tiger have been implemented to protect their habitats and increase their population. Project Tiger is a conservation program launched by the government of India in 1973 to protect and preserve the country's dwindling tiger population. The main goal of the project is to ensure a viable population of tigers in their natural habitats and to protect them from extinction. Project Tiger has led to the establishment of numerous tiger reserves across India. These reserves are protected areas where human activities are restricted, and the natural habitat is preserved. The project also focuses on monitoring tiger populations, conducting research, and raising awareness about the importance of tiger conservation.

Other examples of endemic Indian animal species that are endangered include the Indian rhinoceros, Asiatic Lion, Indian pangolin, and snow leopard. They are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching for animal products. Conservation projects have been implemented to protect these endangered animals, their habitats and increase their population.
